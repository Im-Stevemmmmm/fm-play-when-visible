## Usage
`fm-play-when-visible` provides the `PlayWhenVisible` component, which handles the animation setup through a child function. The child function has an takes in an object that contains a function called `setupAnimationProps`, which is used to create the props for the `motion` JSX tag. The `PlayWhenVisible` component is used as follows...

```js
import React from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { PlayWhenVisible } from "fm-play-when-visible";

const Page = () => {
    return (
        <PlayWhenVisible>
            // Define the child function
            {({ setupAnimationProps }) => (
                // Define your motion tag
                <motion.div
                    // Create the props
                    {...setupAnimationProps({
                        // Your animation variants
                        variants: { from: { opacity: 0 }, to: { opacity: 1 } },
                    })}
                    // Additional props
                    transition={{
                        delay: 1,
                    }}
                >
                    <p>I am fading in!</p>
                </motion.div>
            )}
        </PlayWhenVisible>
    );
};
```

The React component that handles the animation. It requires the child function: `({ setupAnimationProps }) => (...Your JSX here)`.

### PlayWhenVisible Props

| Prop                | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onlyOnce              | false         | If true, the animation plays only once.                                                                                                                                             |
| sensorOptions         | undefined     | The props for the `VisibilitySensor` from `react-visibility-sensor`, excluding `partialVisibility` and `onChange`. Read more in the [react-visibility-sensor props documentation](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor#props). |
| requireFullVisibility | false         | If true, requires that the animation children are fully visible before playing the animation. (Equivalent to `partialVisibility` from  the `VisibilitySensor` props)                            |
| onVisibilityChange    | undefined     | Callback for when the visibility of the animation is changed. (Equivalent to `onChange` from the `VisibilitySensor` props)                                                                        |
